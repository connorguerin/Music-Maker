# Music-Maker
Python project that identifies music and lyric patterns in chart topping songs

The project consists of two portions: lyric analysis and music analysis

Music: Use Music21 to identify common chord progressions and melodic patterns. Use RNN to generate "catchy" music based on the input.

Lyric: Use custom web scraper to scrape lyric data from the web. Use RNN to generate lyrics of the style of certain artists. Incorporate with music component and music21 package to generate sheet music from the NN output.
